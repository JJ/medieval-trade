abstract="Preiser-Kapeller demonstrates how different types of source evidence (archaeological and written) can be used to model the inherent information on the interactions between economic actors and markets in the form of network graphs. Embedded in a larger discussion of the actual complexity of the Roman economy, he exemplary analyses a network of riverine routes and harbours, the ``ORBIS Stanford Geospatial Network Model of the Roman World'', the network of markets and commodities in the ``Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' and the network of potters from Roman potter shops (of terra sigillata) of Rheinzabern. These examples illustrate the emergence of complex patterns of exchange, cooperation and competition from the multitude of interactions within and across various scales of the Roman economy.",

 abstract = {Cliometrics has transformed economic history from a primarily narrative to a mathematical approach, causing much apprehension and debate about the proper balance between economics and history. The culmination of this transformation occurred in 1993 when Clio pioneers Robert Fogel and Douglass North were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science. Cliometrics has walked a fine line between being too narrowly “economic,” whence it would only measure phenomenon that it cannot explain, and too historical, at which point it would cease to appeal to the economics profession. By merging economic history with modern techniques, cliometricians have not ended economic history, but elevated it. La cliométrie a transformé l’histoire économique en passant d’une approche essentiellement narrative à une approche mathématique, suscitant par là même beaucoup d’appréhensions et de débats quant à l’équilibre approprié entre l’économie et l’histoire. Le point culminant de cette transformation s’est produit en 1993 lorsque les pionniers de la cliométrie Robert Fogel et Douglass North ont reçu le prix Nobel de science économique. La cliométrie a réalisé un équilibre délicat entre économie et histoire. Elle n’est ni trop « étroitement » économique, c’est-à-dire qu’elle ne se contente pas de mesurer les phénomènes sans les expliquer, ni trop historique (elle ne rejette pas les contacts avec les économistes). En fusionnant l’histoire économique avec les techniques modernes, les cliométriciens n’ont pas mis fin à l’histoire économique, mais ils lui ont donné une autre dimension.},

abstract = {As the world faces multiple crises, lessons from humanity’s past can potentially suggest ways to decrease disruptions and increase societal resilience. From 1200 to 1100 BCE, several advanced societies in the Eastern Mediterranean suffered dramatic collapse. Though the causes of the Late Bronze Age Collapse are still debated, contributing factors may include a “perfect storm” of multiple stressors: social and economic upheaval, earthquake clusters, climate change, and others. We examined how collapse might have propagated through the societies’ connections by modeling the Eastern Mediterranean Late Bronze Age trade and socio-political networks. Our model shows that the Late Bronze Age societies made a robust network, where any single node’s collapse was insufficient to catalyze the regional collapse that historically transpired. However, modeled scenarios indicate that some paired node disruptions could cause cascading failure within the network. Subsequently, a holistic understanding of the region’s network incentive structures and feedback loops can help societies anticipate compounding risk conditions that might lead to widespread collapse and allow them to take appropriate actions to mitigate or adapt societal dependencies. Such network analyses may be able to provide insight as to how we can prevent a collapse of socio-political, economic and trade networks similar to what occurred at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Though such data-intensive analytics were unavailable to these Bronze Age regions, modern society may be able to leverage historical lessons in order to foster improved robustness and resilience to compounding threats. Our work shows that civilization collapses are preventable; we are not necessarily destined to collapse.}

abstract="Much of eastern and central Europe had been the scene of almost continuous movement and jostling of peoples, migrating, fighting, forming and reforming ethnic identities from long before the inception of the Roman Empire. This period of instability could be said to have begun by the middle of the first millenium bc and was to continue until at least the very end of the first millenium ad. In this context Rome's wars against its `barbarian' neighbours form only a part of a longer and more complex whole. Mutually interactive as they were, the chronologies of the great civilisations of the Mediterranean basin and of this `Age of Migrations' further to the north are by no means synchronous.",
