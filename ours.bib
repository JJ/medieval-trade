ABSTRACT = {The Republic of Venice was one of the longest-lived states in modern history, and its stability and survival have been studied through many different angles. One of the main research angles is to try and find pivotal moments in its history that explain its eventual demise. In this paper, through the rigorous statistical analysis of a dataset of marriages by nobles in the Republic, we attempt to define a methodology for the detection of these events through mono and multivariate changepoint analysis, validating the proposed methodology through cross-validation of different procedures, as well as matching the results to historical events. Our analysis shows that these changepoints occur with statistical significance and that they match political and historical events. These results can be built upon for a better understanding of the historical causes of the success and failure of the Republic of Venice and, by extension, other states.},

ABSTRACT = {During most of the lifespan of the Venetian republic, doges (the name their presidents received) were elected for life. However, a long tenure was a rare event, which effectively resulted in term limits, as has already been reported by several authors. In this paper, we examine the length of these tenures and their evolution during the existence of the Venetian republic, following Smith et al.’s claim that specific events in Venetian history caused this shortening, but also the dates and possibly event or events that effectively caused that limitation by design. Finally, we will discuss the causes of this limitation and its effective consequences.},

abstract = {Trade networks reflect societal vitality and are thus essential tools to understand historical dynamics, including epochal events. In this paper we will be looking at the Mediterranean trade network reflected in the FLAME dataset, coin hoards found in the region which establish a link between the place the coins were minted and where they were found. We will use changepoint analysis to identify shift points in this trade network, mapping it to actual events (or conjunction of events), and then analyze the existing network prior and after the events. The trade network has regions (identified as current countries) as nodes, and the number of coins of one place found in another as edges.
Changepoint analysis for the time series of the number of links in the network finds a statistically significant changepoint with average links before and after the changepoint plotted. Multiple sequence changepoint, including entropy and high-level network measures, will be also presented, and possible causes for these shifts, looking at historical events as well as changes in edge and node (region) betweenness, will be discussed.},
