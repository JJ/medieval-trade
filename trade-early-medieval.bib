abstract = {Understanding past hydroclimate dynamics of the Eastern Mediterranean is crucial for predicting future climate impacts. However, the ‘Marmara Transition Zone’ in northwest Türkiye, a region of significant societal transformation, lacks high-resolution pre-industrial climate records. Continuous paleoclimate reconstructions are critical to reveal the nature and pattern of Late Holocene hydroclimatic changes and extremes, and to study their impacts on societies. Here, we present a precisely dated and sub-decadal resolution speleothem record from Uzuntarla cave, located near to Istanbul (historically Byzantium and Constantinople), that shows sensitivity to cold-season rainfall amount and seasonality for the Late Holocene. Prior to 2005 CE, stalagmite U-1 reveals two periods of high multidecadal variability of cold-seasonal rainfall in ∼1900-400 BCE and ∼690–1900 CE, separated by a relatively stable phase. This variability aligns with the rise and fall of Byzantine agrarian productivity between ∼350 and 1250 CE, while the most pronounced aridification anomaly in ∼1210-1170 BCE coincides with the collapse of the Hittite Empire (c. ∼1200 BCE), partly linked to regional famine and drought. Our findings indicate that the transition from the Late Bronze Age to the Iron Age in the Marmara Transition Zone was marked by a pronounced shift in the regional climate regime. Namely, that a previously warmer and more stable 'Mediterranean-style' climate shifted toward cooler conditions characterised by increased rainfall variability, and a greater influence of moisture sourced from the Black Sea. Therefore, we suggest that cold-seasonal rains played a critical role in shaping human-climate interactions, power dynamics, and social stability in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Holocene. This record offers valuable context for understanding how hydroclimate variability influenced past societies, highlighting the importance of climate as a driver in historical societal resilience and collapse.}

While accumulating, entering, and displaying the data, the project’s leadership has become increasingly aware of the inherent distortions in these data. These deviations operate on various levels, from the disparate events that provide the coin finds that serve as the basis of its data to previously unexamined scholarly biases that underpin such a quantitative approach to historical analysis. By systematically examining these phenomena, we hope to frame a discussion of such inherent biases in other digital humanities undertakings.},

abstract = {An 1100 BCE to 800 CE record of estimated lead emissions based on continuous, subannually resolved, and precisely dated measurements of lead pollution in deep Greenland ice and atmospheric modeling shows that European emissions closely varied with historical events, including imperial expansion, wars, and major plagues. Emissions rose coeval with Phoenician expansion and accelerated during expanded Carthaginian and Roman lead–silver mining primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. Emissions fluctuated synchronously with wars and political instability, particularly during the Roman Republic, reaching a sustained maximum during the Roman Empire before plunging in the second century coincident with the Antonine plague, and remaining low for \&gt;500 years. Bullion in silver coinage declined in parallel, reflecting the importance of lead–silver mining in ancient economies. Lead pollution in Arctic ice reflects midlatitude emissions from ancient lead–silver mining and smelting. The few reported measurements have been extrapolated to infer the performance of ancient economies, including comparisons of economic productivity and growth during the Roman Republican and Imperial periods. These studies were based on sparse sampling and inaccurate dating, limiting understanding of trends and specific linkages. Here we show, using a precisely dated record of estimated lead emissions between 1100 BCE and 800 CE derived from subannually resolved measurements in Greenland ice and detailed atmospheric transport modeling, that annual European lead emissions closely varied with historical events, including imperial expansion, wars, and major plagues. Emissions rose coeval with Phoenician expansion, accelerated during expanded Carthaginian and Roman mining primarily in the Iberian Peninsula, and reached a maximum under the Roman Empire. Emissions fluctuated synchronously with wars and political instability particularly during the Roman Republic, and plunged coincident with two major plagues in the second and third centuries, remaining low for \&gt;500 years. Bullion in silver coinage declined in parallel, reflecting the importance of lead–silver mining in ancient economies. Our results indicate sustained economic growth during the first two centuries of the Roman Empire, terminated by the second-century Antonine plague.}}

abstract = {The detrimental effects of modern lead exposure on human health are widely recognized. Evidence from the Roman era indicates substantial lead exposure that potentially impacted human health more than 2,000 y ago. The most significant exposure for the rural, nonelite population may have been to background air pollution from silver mining and smelting that underpinned the Roman economy. Using detailed records of Roman-era lead pollution measured in Arctic ice cores and atmospheric modeling, we show that lead emissions from these activities elevated air concentrations throughout Europe. Based on modern epidemiological studies, this air pollution enhanced childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) by about 2.4 µg/dl leading to widespread cognitive decline including an estimated 2.5-to-3 point reduction in intelligence quotient. Ancient texts and archaeological evidence indicate substantial lead exposure during antiquity that potentially impacted human health. Although lead exposure routes were many and included the use of glazed tablewares, paints, cosmetics, and even intentional ingestion, the most significant for the nonelite, rural majority of the population may have been through background air pollution from mining and smelting of silver and lead ores that underpinned the Roman economy. Here, we determined potential health effects of this air pollution using Arctic ice core measurements of Roman-era lead pollution, atmospheric modeling, and modern epidemiology-based relationships between air concentrations, blood lead levels (BLLs), and cognitive decline. Findings suggest air lead concentrations exceeded 150 ng/m3 near metallurgical emission sources, with average enhancements of \&gt;1.0 ng/m3 over Europe during the Pax Romana apogee of the Roman Empire. The result was blood lead enhancements in young children of about 2.4 µg/dl above an estimated Neolithic background of 1.0 µg/dl, leading to widespread cognitive decline including a 2.5-to-3 point reduction in intelligence quotient throughout the Roman Empire.}}
