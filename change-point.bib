    abstract = { Interval-censored failure time data occur in many medical investigations as well as other studies such as demographical and sociological studies. They include the usual right-censored failure time data as a special case but provide much more complex structure and less relevant information than the right-censored data. This article reviews some basic concepts, issues and the corresponding statistical approaches related to the analysis of interval-censored data as well as recent advances. In particular, we discuss estimation of a survival function, comparison of several treatments and regression analysis as well as competing risks analysis and truncation in the presence of interval censoring. A well-known example of interval-censored data is described and analysed to illustrate some of the statistical procedures discussed. }

abstract = {Abstract This article measures technological progress in oceanic shipping directly by using a large database of daily log entries from British, Dutch, and Spanish ships to estimate daily sailing speed in different wind conditions from 1750 to 1850. Against the consensus among economic (but not maritime) historians that the technology of sailing ships was fairly static during this time, we find that average sailing speeds of British East India Company and Navy ships in moderate to strong winds rose considerably after the 1770s. Driving this progress was the introduction of coppering in the 1780s, but subsequent rises are probably due to a continuous evolution of sails and rigging, and improved hulls that allowed a greater area of sail to be set safely in a given wind. By contrast, the speeds of Dutch and Spanish vessels were stagnant. Using separate data on the crossing times of Atlantic mail packets, we find gradual progress from the 1750s, followed by marked improvements when American packets appeared in the 1820s.},

abstract = {Industrial revolutions can be linked to fundamental technological inventions that have provided mankind with subsidiary and complementary developments. Breakthrough changes have occurred in energy sources, telecommunication technologies, transportation methods, and production systems during the periods covered by industrial revolutions. Altogether these changes have accelerated the march of economic progress resulting in social transformations. While economies of frontier countries benefitted vastly from such changes, others had delays in following the advances. Therefore, observed effects of industrial revolutions varied among countries. In this study, it is assumed that there are identifiable economic changes during industrial revolutions. Real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is used as an indicator to trace economic growth in the UK, the US, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Turkey. The real GDP per capita time series of the countries mentioned are modelled by autoregressive integrated moving average models and a cumulative sum scheme is utilized to detect the change points in successive periods corresponding to industrial revolutions. Together with the levels of the real GDP per capita after a change, timings of the changes are compared for the countries studied. Results indicate that there are delays for some countries in benefiting from the prosperity offered by the developments.}

We conduct a full change point analysis of well-documented, publicly available battle deaths data sets, using new techniques that enable the robust detection of changes in the statistical properties of such heavy-tailed data. We first test and calibrate these techniques. We then demonstrate the existence of changes, independent of data presentation, in the early to mid-19th century, as the Congress of Vienna system moved towards its collapse, in the early to mid-20th century, bracketing the World Wars, and in the late 20th century, as the world reconfigured around the end of the Cold War. Our analysis provides a methodology for future investigations and an empirical basis for political and historical discussions.}",

year = {2014},
publisher = {USENIX Association},

abstract = {High availability and performance of a web service is key, amongst other factors, to the overall user experience (which in turn directly impacts the bottom-line). Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies that make maintaining high availability and delivering high performance very challenging. Although there exists a large body of prior research in anomaly detection, existing techniques are not suitable for detecting long-term anomalies owing to a predominant underlying trend component in the time series data.To this end, we developed a novel statistical technique to automatically detect long-term anomalies in cloud data. Specifically, the technique employs statistical learning to detect anomalies in both application as well as system metrics. Further, the technique uses robust statistical metrics, viz., median, and median absolute deviation (MAD), and piecewise approximation of the underlying long-term trend to accurately detect anomalies even in the presence of intra-day and/or weekly seasonality. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using production data and report Precision, Recall, and F-measure measure. Multiple teams at Twitter are currently using the proposed technique on a daily basis.},
